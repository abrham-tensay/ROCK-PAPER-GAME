# ROCK-PAPER-GAME
This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game where users can play against the computer. The game allows the user to choose one of three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the computer randomly selects one as well. The winner is determined based on the standard rules:
Step 1: Setup the project structure
Step 2: Write the logic to get the computer choice
Step 3: Write the logic to get the human choice
Step 4: Declare the players score variables
Step 5: Write the logic to play a single round
Step 6: Write the logic to play the entire game
